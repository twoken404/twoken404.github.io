    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>The topic we’re going to talk about today might sound a bit mysterious. It’s called <em>The Quantum Life of a Dollar</em>. You might be thinking, what’s there to talk about with just one dollar? What does quantum have to do with me? Don’t worry, I’m not going to lecture you on physics. What I want to reveal to you is the enormous secret hidden behind this tiny dollar in your pocket—a secret you’ve never seen before. This secret directly determines our wealth gap, determines the rise and fall of the global economy, and even determines how many chips each one of us gets in the big casino that is society.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a scene that seems distant but is intimately connected to us. March 18, 2020, Washington D.C. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is holding an emergency video conference. On the screen are the anxious faces of the Congressional Budget Committee. Mnuchin says, “We need 2.3 trillion dollars.” This was just two weeks after the pandemic outbreak. 3.5 million people had applied for unemployment benefits, the healthcare system was on the verge of collapse, and small businesses were failing en masse. Where was the money going to come from? Unemployment benefits, business subsidies, cash payments to every American, and healthcare expenses. Someone timidly asks, “Raise taxes?” Mnuchin shakes his head, “Too late, and raising taxes during a recession is suicide. There’s only one way: issue debt.”</p>
<p>The US government issues debt every year. In 2019, federal revenue was 3.5 trillion, expenditure was 4.4 trillion, leaving a deficit of 900 billion. This gap was plugged by issuing debt. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit, the scale of the deficit exploded. On March 20th, the U.S. Treasury announced it would issue 3 trillion dollars in new Treasury bonds over the next three months—a direct historical record. Then the parameters for the first batch were set: a 10-year Treasury note, with a coupon rate of 0.625%, and an issuance size of 500 billion dollars.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. on March 23rd, the primary market auction begins. Now, let’s shift our perspective to the other side of the planet, the trading floor of JPMorgan Chase in Manhattan, New York. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the streets are empty. Traders are all working remotely from home. The trading head says on a Zoom call, “The Treasury is auctioning 500 billion in 10-year notes on Monday. We are a primary dealer, we must participate in the bidding.”</p>
<p>Listen up, primary dealers—this is a privileged class. They are the 24 institutions personally certified by the Federal Reserve, like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and also BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Nomura, Barclays, etc. They are the core of the U.S. Treasury issuance mechanism. What are the privileges and obligations of these primary dealers? Their obligation is that they must participate in every Treasury auction by the Treasury Department, providing liquidity. Their privilege is that they can borrow directly from the Fed and also sell bonds directly to the Fed.</p>
<p>JPMorgan’s chief trader, while staring at an Excel spreadsheet, calculates, “We’re preparing to bid for 50 billion, expected yield 0.68%, price 99.62. If we win, we have to pay 50 billion dollars that same day.” Where does the money come from? someone asks. “First, use our capital to advance the payment. After winning the auction, immediately distribute to clients—pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds.” Or, he pauses, his eyes sweeping over everyone, “or sell to the Fed.”</p>
<p>The meeting room suddenly falls silent. Everyone understands what he’s hinting at.</p>
<p>11 a.m., March 23rd, the New York Fed’s electronic auction system starts operating. The 24 primary dealers’ traders sit at their home computers, fingers flying across the keyboards. The system pops up the auction information: U.S. 10-year Treasury note, issuance amount 500 billion dollars, coupon rate 0.625%, maturing March 31, 2030. Bidding starts at 11 a.m. and ends at 11:30 a.m. Each institution inputs their acceptable price and quantity: JPMorgan Chase, 50 billion, price 99.58; Goldman Sachs, 45 billion, price 99.60; Citigroup, 40 billion, price 99.55…</p>
<p>11:29:50, the last ten seconds. Traders modifying prices have fingers dancing fast. Click. 11:30 sharp, bidding closes, the system starts calculating. Thirty seconds later, results are announced: Total bid amount 1.273 trillion dollars, final allocation 500 billion dollars, bid-to-cover ratio 2.55 times, highest yield 0.685%, lowest yield 0.658%. Primary dealers took 18.2%. Done!</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase was allocated 50 billion dollars in Treasuries. The Treasury’s TGA account—the one held at the New York Fed—immediately received 500 billion dollars in cash. Treasury officials watch the account balance jump and breathe a long sigh of relief. This money would flow within 48 hours to state unemployment insurance systems to pay benefits; to the Small Business Administration for the PPP loan program; to the IRS to send $1,200 stimulus checks to every American adult; and to the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase ventilators and protective equipment.</p>
<p>But JPMorgan’s trading heads stare at their screens, frowning. They just paid 50 billion dollars and received 50 billion dollars in Treasuries. Cash on their books decreased massively. Clients hadn’t had time to take on these bonds. Liquidity gap: 50 billion dollars. In normal times, this wouldn’t be a problem at all. Bonds would quickly be distributed to pension funds, insurance companies, foreign central banks, and cash would soon flow back. But March 2020 was not normal times. The market was panicking, stocks were plummeting, the credit market was freezing. Every institution was hoarding cash; no one wanted to buy assets.</p>
<p>“We must sell these Treasuries,” the CFO says, “otherwise our capital adequacy ratio will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>Sell to whom? Everyone’s gaze once again turns in the same direction: the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The same day, 2 p.m., the Fed’s trading floor. The New York Fed’s trading head walks into the almost empty hall and presses the red button on the desk. A huge screen lights up, displaying a real-time instruction from Fed Chair Jerome Powell: “Federal Reserve System, unlimited quantitative easing, operation twist authorized. Purchase unlimited U.S. Treasury securities, to all primary dealers, 24 institutions. Objective: Ensure market liquidity and normal functioning. Effective immediately. Fed Chair, Jerome Powell.”</p>
<p>This was an unprecedented moment in human monetary history. “Unlimited” quantitative easing—not 100 billion, not 500 billion, but unlimited!</p>
<p>The trader sits down, opens the purchase system, sets the parameters. Purchase program activated: Target U.S. Treasury securities, all maturities; Daily purchase limit, no ceiling; Price, market price plus 0.05; Auto-execute.</p>
<p>Yes! JPMorgan’s trader sees the Fed’s buy order, his eyes light up. He immediately posts a sell order: 50 billion dollars in 10-year Treasuries, yield 0.67%, for immediate settlement. The Fed system automatically matches, auto-executes. In an instant, two things happen simultaneously:</p>
<p>First, JPMorgan’s account—their reserve account held at the New York Fed—previously had a balance of 45.23 billion dollars. The transaction adds 50 billion dollars (as the Fed purchases the 10-year notes). New balance: 50.23 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Second, the Fed’s balance sheet: on the asset side, U.S. Treasury holdings increase by 50 billion dollars; on the liability side, bank reserves increase by 50 billion dollars.</p>
<p>You see, no armored trucks, no printing presses, no vaults. Just an operator typing an instruction, updating numbers in a database. Me and my 4.999999999 billion siblings were born out of thin air at this very moment.</p>
<p>I am just one dollar among them, serial number QE4-2020-0323-B7F9. I am pure digital, existing in the Fed’s servers, a bit in JPMorgan’s reserve account. I have no physical form, no weight, no color. But I have value, because the Fed says I do, because the credit of the U.S. government backs me, because the whole world believes in me.</p>
<p>On JPMorgan’s balance sheet, reserves jump from 45 billion to 50.2 billion. At the executive meeting the next morning, the CFO says, “We have 5 billion more in liquidity on our books. The Fed is still buying bonds; money is everywhere in the market. These reserves sitting at the Fed only earn 0.1% interest. We must put them to work.”</p>
<p>The Chief Investment Officer chimes in, “The stock market just crashed 30%. Now is the golden opportunity to buy the dip.”</p>
<p>Folks, this is the starting point of the “Cantillon Effect.” Back in the 18th century, the Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon discovered a secret. He said that when new money enters the economic system, not everyone gets it at the same time. Those who receive the new money first can buy assets at old prices. And when the new money has flowed throughout the entire economy, causing general price increases, those who get the money last can only buy things at new, higher prices. In other words, the beneficiaries of money printing depend on how close you are to the printing press.</p>
<p>In March 2020, the Fed printed 5 trillion dollars. So, who was closest to the printing press?</p>
<p>First, zero meters: the Fed itself. They create money out of thin air, with infinite purchasing power.<br>Second, ten meters: the 24 primary dealers. JPMorgan Chase is right here. They get the new money directly from the Fed, and at this point, asset prices haven’t had time to rise yet. Of course, I’m right here now.<br>Then, one hundred meters: hedge funds, private equity, and big investors. They get money from the primary dealers. At this point, asset prices have just started to rise, but the increase is limited.<br>Then, one kilometer: large corporations, publicly traded companies. They can raise funds from financial markets. At this point, asset prices have already risen somewhat, but they can raise money by issuing bonds or stocks.<br>Then, ten kilometers: small and medium business owners. They get loans from banks. At this point, borrowing costs have started to rise, and competition has become fiercer.<br>Finally, one hundred kilometers—the far end of the Cantillon Effect: ordinary wage earners. They rely on salary income. And by this time, prices have risen across the board, while their wage increases lag far behind inflation.</p>
<p>JPMorgan quickly deployed the 50 billion dollars, including me.<br>First, buying the dip in stocks: 20 billion dollars. The head of equity trading says, “The Nasdaq fell from 9,000 to 6,500, down 28%. Buy tech stocks: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla.” On March 23rd, these stocks were still very cheap.<br>Then, corporate bonds: 15 billion dollars. The head of fixed income says, “Investment-grade corporate bond yields spiked to 6%, junk bonds to 10%. The Fed has hinted it will buy corporate bonds. Risk is limited, returns are attractive.” They bought bonds from Boeing, Delta Air Lines, Carnival Cruise Lines.<br>Next, private equity: 10 billion dollars, invested in KKR’s leveraged buyout fund, Blackstone’s real estate fund, and Bridgewater’s All Weather strategy.<br>Finally, 5 billion dollars was put into ten funds.</p>
<p>It was here that I was allocated to CTD Capital, a top quantitative hedge fund. CTD Capital’s trading algorithms received the capital injection signal and immediately started operating. Me and several hundred million other dollars were deployed: 60% into long equity positions—long tech stocks in AI, long electric vehicle stocks Tesla and Nio, long cloud computing stocks Snowflake and Datadog; 20% into options trading—buying call options, using 10x to 20x leverage; 10% into the cryptocurrency market—indirectly investing in Bitcoin through Coinbase and MicroStrategy; and the final 10% kept as cash, waiting for better entry opportunities.</p>
<p>Three months later, a miracle happened. From March to June 2020, during the worst of the pandemic with skyrocketing unemployment, U.S. stocks began a staggering rebound: Tesla went from $86 to $215, up 150%; Apple rose 63%; Amazon rose 43%; Zoom rose 125%; the Nasdaq index rebounded 40% from its low. CTD Capital’s fund returned 37% in three months. My original one dollar became $1.37 on paper.</p>
<p>A CNBC host said, puzzled, “This doesn’t make sense. Unemployment is 20%, GDP is shrinking, but the stock market is hitting new highs.” A hedge fund manager said in an interview, “It makes perfect sense. The Fed printed 5 trillion dollars. Where is that money going to go? Into assets, of course: stocks, bonds, real estate, Bitcoin. Never fight the Fed.”</p>
<p>The first stage of the Cantillon Effect was complete: holders of financial assets saw their wealth soar; wage earners faced unemployment or pay cuts; the wealth gap widened at the fastest pace in history.</p>
<p>I, this one dollar, was born on March 23, 2020. Just six months later, I had already generated hedge fund management fees (2%), performance fees (20% of profits), capital gains from stock appreciation, and leveraged returns from options trading, etc. But all these profits flowed to the insiders of the financial system. The unemployed waitress, the bankrupt small business owner, the tenant evicted by the landlord—they didn’t get a single cent.</p>
<p>Even more cruel: when true inflation arrived, they would become its biggest victims. The <em>Financial Times</em> published a report in August 2020: The total wealth of U.S. billionaires increased by 561 billion dollars during the pandemic, a rise of 49%. During the same period, 40 million people lost their jobs, and 12 million lost their health insurance. Why? Billionaires’ wealth is mostly in stocks, real estate, and corporate equity. The 5 trillion dollars printed by the Fed directly pushed up the prices of these assets. Ordinary people’s wealth is mainly in wages. Once unemployed or facing pay cuts, without assets, they cannot share in the dividends of money printing.</p>
<p>September 2020, the global economy began to recover. China emerged first from the pandemic, factories reopened, exports surged. CTD Capital decided to reallocate assets, reduce some U.S. stock holdings, and turn to the ADRs of Chinese tech stocks—American Depositary Receipts. Me and other funds were used to buy U.S.-listed ADRs of Alibaba, Tencent, and Pinduoduo. These companies operate in China and need to repatriate some funds for business expansion, like building data centers, investing in R&amp;D, acquiring companies, etc.</p>
<p>The cross-border payment system SWIFT immediately kicked in. System record: From Citibank New York Branch to Bank of China Shenzhen Branch, amount 10 billion dollars, beneficiary Alibaba Group Holding Limited, remarks “Capital injection for Cainiao Logistics expansion.” I traveled from a Citibank account in New York, through the SWIFT network, to HSBC in Hong Kong, then to Bank of China in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market in Hong Kong&#x2F;Shenzhen, I changed clothes again. In a spot FX transaction, 10 billion dollars were sold, and 6.8 billion Chinese yuan were bought at an exchange rate of 6.8. I was exchanged into renminbi. More precisely, my dollar identity was transferred to the party selling yuan, which was the Chinese central bank acting through commercial banks. I entered the foreign exchange reserves of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)—a vast ocean of numbers, 3.2 trillion dollars, the world’s largest forex reserves.</p>
<p>I lay quietly under the “foreign exchange assets” item on the PBOC’s balance sheet, becoming the credit backing for the renminbi in the hands of 1.4 billion Chinese people. This reveals a secret: the old mechanism for issuing renminbi, the dominant model before 2015, was this: China exports goods to the U.S., earns dollars; exporters exchange dollars for yuan at Chinese banks; commercial banks then sell the dollars to the central bank, and the central bank pays yuan to the commercial banks. So, the basis for the central bank’s money printing was the increase in foreign exchange reserves. This means China’s holding of 3.2 trillion dollars in reserves roughly corresponds to the issuance of about 22 trillion yuan. The dollar is the “anchor” for the yuan.</p>
<p>The PBOC’s foreign exchange reserve management department faces a daily dilemma: 3.2 trillion dollars cannot sit idle; it must be invested to preserve and grow value. What should I invest in?</p>
<p>Option 1: U.S. Treasuries. The safest. Pros: nominally AAA-rated, unbeatable liquidity, and dollar-denominated. Con: yield only 0.7%, can’t beat inflation.<br>Option 2: U.S. stocks. Pros: high long-term returns. Cons: politically sensitive (e.g., “Chinese government controlling U.S. companies”), and highly volatile.<br>Option 3: European or Japanese assets. Pros: diversify risk. Con: the yen is also depreciating, yields are even lower.<br>Option 4: Gold, commodities. Pros: hedge against inflation. Cons: don’t generate interest, high storage costs.<br>Option 5: Belt and Road investments. Pros: supports national strategy. Cons: high risk, many projects have been loss-making.</p>
<p>So you find that the realistic choice is, according to 2020 data: 60-65% of China’s forex reserve assets are in U.S. Treasuries; 5-8% in U.S. agency bonds; 3-5% in U.S. stocks (held via sovereign wealth funds); 15-20% in euro assets; 5% in yen assets; and another 5% in others, like gold, SDRs, and emerging market bonds.</p>
<p>The conclusion is: Whether China likes it or not, it must hold a large amount of dollar assets. This is the essence of dollar hegemony.</p>
<p>November 2020, the U.S. election ended, Biden won. Markets expected a new round of fiscal stimulus. The PBOC’s forex management department issued an instruction: Buy 10 billion dollars in 10-year U.S. Treasuries, locking in the current relatively low yield. But note: we’re not buying bonds directly from the U.S. Treasury. The transaction is done through the New York Fed’s proxy account in the secondary market. The seller is a Wall Street hedge fund: Bridgewater. They were reallocating assets at the time.</p>
<p>The trade confirmation shows: Date November 15, 2020; Security: 10-year U.S. Treasury note, coupon 0.625%, maturing 2030; Amount: 10 billion dollars; Price: 99.45; Yield: 0.72%. Buyer: People’s Bank of China via New York Fed’s custody account. Seller: Bridgewater Asset Management via JPMorgan’s custody account. Settlement: T+1, i.e., November 16, 2020.</p>
<p>The fund flow: PBOC account -&gt; New York Fed custody account -&gt; JPMorgan -&gt; Bridgewater account. So you see, I flowed from the PBOC to Bridgewater. The Treasury bond flow: Bridgewater custody account -&gt; New York Fed custody system -&gt; PBOC custody account.</p>
<p>Key insights here:<br>Point 1: China bought Treasuries, but the dollars aren’t locked away. The dollars continue to circulate within the U.S. financial system; only the ownership of the bonds changed hands.<br>Point 2: Secondary market liquidity is the cornerstone of U.S. debt credibility. Daily trading volume of U.S. Treasuries is 600-700 billion dollars. Central banks can buy and sell anytime. This liquidity maintains the dollar’s reserve currency status.<br>Point 3: The U.S. gets a double benefit: Seller Bridgewater gets 10 billion dollars to invest in the U.S. economy. Buyer PBOC helps stabilize Treasury prices, effectively lowering yields.</p>
<p>Bridgewater received the 10 billion dollars, including me. Founder Ray Dalio said in an internal meeting, “The Fed is printing money; inflation is inevitable. We should allocate 40% to inflation-protected assets like TIPS, commodities, and gold; 30% to stocks like energy, materials, and financials; 20% to emerging markets; and 10% cash.”</p>
<p>I was allocated to the stock account, specifically invested in the energy stock ExxonMobil. In November 2020, ExxonMobil’s stock price was $33. By June 2021, it rose to $63, a 91% gain. I increased in value again.</p>
<p>But folks, this increase was different from the first one. The first, from March to June 2020, was a rebound from panic, a flood of liquidity. The second, from November 2020 to June 2021, was inflation expectation, the real economy beginning to feel the impact of money printing. Energy prices were rising, raw material prices rising, transportation costs rising. The flames of inflation began spreading from financial markets to the real economy.</p>
<p>April 2021, a turning point arrived. ExxonMobil declared a dividend. Bridgewater received some cash returns. Me and other funds flowed back into the fund’s cash account.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Saudi student named Omar was studying for his MBA at the University of Southern California. His father was a senior executive at Saudi Aramco and had just received a huge bonus because oil prices had rebounded 300% from their 2020 lows. The father wired $5,000 to Omar for living expenses.</p>
<p>The fund path: Saudi National Bank Riyadh Branch, via SWIFT to Saudi National Bank New York Branch, then via domestic U.S. transfer to Omar’s Bank of America account in Los Angeles. Part of this $5,000, ultimately traceable back, originated from the liquidity pool of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF, and part of PIF’s funds were invested in Bridgewater.</p>
<p>Thus, I became one dollar in Omar’s account.</p>
<p>April 15, 2021, a Bank of America branch in Century City, Los Angeles. Omar walks up to the ATM, inserts his card, enters his PIN, selects “Withdraw $100,” confirms. The ATM’s internal mechanisms start working.</p>
<p>Transaction record shows: Date April 15, 2021, 2:32:17 PM; Account: Omar’s account; Transaction: Cash withdrawal, amount $100.</p>
<p>Digital steps: Verify account balance: $5,027.89; Deduct amount: Balance $5,127.89; Update ledger: Complete; Authorize dispense $100.</p>
<p>Physical steps: Cassette #2, $1 bills; Dispense 100 bills; Verifier scans serial numbers; Bills exit dispenser, delivered.</p>
<p>From the cash cassette, 100 one-dollar bills are picked by a robotic arm, arranged, and sent to the dispenser. One of them has serial number L92047856G, printed in November 2019, already in circulation for a year and a half. That’s me.</p>
<p>For the first time, I had a physical form. From a line of record in a database, I became a tangible banknote with dimensions, weight, material, color, and design. I went from bit to atom.</p>
<p>Omar stuffs me and the other bills into his wallet, leaves the bank, drives to Santa Monica. Omar walks into this trendy coffee shop. He remembers coming here once last year, in 2020, when a pour-over coffee cost just $3.50. He looks at the menu board: the April 2021 menu. Single-origin pour-over: $4.50, up; Latte: $5.25, also up; Cappuccino: $5.00, up; Cortado: $4.75, still up. There’s a small note below: “Price increase due to rising costs.”</p>
<p>Price increase? Omar asks the barista. Barista Maria, a tired 26-year-old Mexican immigrant, smiles and says, “Yes, the boss says costs have gone up too much. If we don’t raise prices, we’ll have to close.”</p>
<p>Let’s break down this coffee shop’s cost changes to understand: March 2020, a pound of Ethiopian coffee beans: $12; by April 2021: $16, a 33% increase. Milk prices: up 21%. Shop rent: up 8%. Employee wages: minimum wage increased from $13 to $14 per hour, a 7.7% rise. Utilities (water, electricity, gas): up 11%. Packaging supplies, like paper cups and lids: from $0.12 each to $0.18 each, a whopping 50% increase. Average cost increase: about 22%. But menu prices only went up 28%, meaning profit margins were severely squeezed. “This is already our third price increase,” owner Carlos sighs in the back kitchen. “Raise prices again and customers won’t come; don’t raise them and we lose money.”</p>
<p>Omar orders a pour-over, pays $4.50. Me and three other one-dollar bills, plus two quarters, are placed into the cash register by Maria.</p>
<p>That night, Maria finishes her 8-hour shift. She calculates her income for the month: hourly wage $14, up a dollar from last year (7.7% increase); hours: 35 per week (the boss cut hours to reduce costs). Monthly income after taxes and social security: about $1,700 take-home.</p>
<p>Her expenses? Rent (a room in a shared apartment): from $800 to $900, a 12.5% increase. Food (groceries and eating out): from $350 to $480, a 37% increase. Transportation (bus and occasional taxi): up 20%. Utilities&#x2F;Internet share: up 25%. Phone bill: up 12.5%. Student loan minimum payment: unchanged. Basic health insurance: up 7%. Total expenses went from $1,700 to $2,005, an 18% increase.</p>
<p>In March 2020, Maria earned $1,700, spent $1,700, balance zero. By April 2021, income $1,700, expenses $2,005, deficit $305. Maria looks at her bank account balance: only $237. “I need to find a second job,” she tells her roommate, “or move further away, but then transportation costs will go up again.”</p>
<p>This is the brutal far end of the Cantillon Effect.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the full panorama of the Cantillon Effect from March 2020 to April 2021:<br>First, the Fed and primary dealers. They got the new 5 trillion dollars first, bought assets at old prices. Wealth grew 20% to 100%.<br>Second, hedge funds, private equity, and the wealthy. They got money 3-6 months later. Asset prices had already risen somewhat but limitedly. Wealth grew 20% to 100%.<br>Then, the middle class with stocks or property. They felt asset appreciation 6-12 months later, but inflation was also rising by then. Wealth grew 5% to 30%.<br>Next, small business owners. They got PPP loans, but costs skyrocketed, profits were squeezed. Wealth growth: 0% to 10%.<br>Then, wage earners. Their wages rose 7.7%, living costs rose 18%. Real purchasing power fell by about 10%.<br>Finally, the unemployed and gig economy workers. Their incomes fell sharply or became unstable, living costs soared. Real purchasing power fell 20% to 50%.</p>
<p>The next day, Maria takes me and a few other bills to Ralphs supermarket. Pushing her cart, she’s shocked by the price tags: A dozen eggs, from $2.99 to $4.29, up 43%; a gallon of milk, up 37%; whole wheat bread, up 32%; chicken breast per pound, up 38%; broccoli per pound, up 40%; cooking oil, up 50%; tomatoes per pound, up 54%.</p>
<p>Her shopping list originally had 12 items, budget $50. But at checkout, with only 8 items, she’d already spent $52. She hands me and the other cash to the cashier.</p>
<p>My purchasing power? In March 2020, I could buy two pounds of chicken, or a dozen eggs plus a box of cereal. By April 2021, I could only buy a quarter-gallon of milk, or half a pound of chicken. I depreciated about 30% in thirteen months.</p>
<p>From the supermarket cash register, I flow into the supermarket owner’s account. Soon after, I’m used to pay an employee’s wages. Employee Jose gets his wages and pays rent to his landlord. I return to the digital world, from atomic state back to bit state.</p>
<p>Landlord Mr. Chen is a first-generation Chinese immigrant who owns three properties in LA. After receiving the rent, he checks his investment account: March 2020, property value $1.8 million, stock investments $200,000, total assets $2 million. April 2021, property value $2.4 million, up 33%; stock investments $310,000, up 55%; total assets $2.71 million, an increase of 35.5%.</p>
<p>Sitting in his living room sipping tea, he marvels, “I didn’t do anything, and my assets grew by $710,000. This country is crazy.”</p>
<p>Downstairs, in her $900-a-month rented room, Maria uses a calculator to figure out how to get through the month.</p>
<p>Folks, the same inflation means wealth appreciation for those with assets, but a survival crisis for those without.</p>
<p>For the next two years, 2021 to 2023, I underwent many transitions between bit and atom:</p>
<p>May 2021, Atom to Bit: Mr. Chen deposits the rent into Chase Bank. I go from cash to a number in a bank account.<br>June 2021, Bit to Bit: Mr. Chen uses me to invest in stocks, buying NVIDIA. I move from Chase account to Fidelity investment account.<br>December 2021, Bit to Bit: NVIDIA stock price up 80%, Mr. Chen takes some profits. I flow with the funds into a real estate investment trust (REIT).<br>March 2022, Bit to Bit: The REIT pays a dividend. Mr. Chen withdraws some cash for home renovation. I’m spat out by an ATM and handed to construction worker Carlos.<br>April to August 2022, Atom to Atom: Carlos uses me to buy materials at Home Depot; Home Depot gives change to customer Sarah; Sarah uses me to buy organic vegetables at the farmers’ market; the farmer deposits me into a bank. I experience twelve physical-world transactions in five months.<br>August 2022, Atom to Bit: Farmer makes a deposit, I return to the digital world.<br>September 2022 to June 2023, Bit constantly changing: The farmer’s bank lends me to a small business; the small business uses me to pay a supplier; the supplier deposits me into another bank; that bank buys U.S. Treasuries… I circulate within the financial system for nine months.</p>
<p>During these two years, in my dual digital and physical forms, I witnessed:<br>In the bit-world of finance: The cryptocurrency frenzy (Bitcoin from $10k to $69k to $16k), the NFT bubble (digital pictures selling for millions), the tech stock crash (Meta down 70%, Netflix down 75%), soaring inflation data (CPI from 1.4% to 9.1%), and the Fed’s疯狂加息 (interest rates from 0% to 5.25%).<br>In the atom-world of reality: Construction worker Carlos’s wage rose 15%, but rent rose 25%; organic tomatoes at the farmers’ market from $4&#x2F;lb to $6.50&#x2F;lb; Home Depot’s 2x4 lumber from $3 to $8 then back to $5; gasoline from $2.80&#x2F;gallon to $5.80&#x2F;gallon; the Third Wave coffee shop changed owners three times before finally closing down.</p>
<p>Folks, the same me, shuttling between two worlds, witnessed the violent oscillations of two parallel universes.</p>
<p>March 2022, the Fed launched the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in forty years. The federal funds rate went from 0.25% in March 2022, to 1.75% in June, to 3.25% in September, 4.5% in December, and finally 5.5% by July 2023. Each 0.75% hike was like a hammer blow to financial markets.</p>
<p>I was in a pension account at the time, invested in a bond fund. Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. When the Fed raised rates from 0.25% to 5.5%, the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 0.7% to 4.8%, and bond prices crashed about 40%. My book value fell from $1.37 back to $0.95.</p>
<p>The stock market was even worse: Nasdaq down 35% from its high; Tesla from $1,200 to $108, down 91%; Apple from $338 to $88, down 74%. In 2022, both U.S. stocks and bonds fell simultaneously. Investors truly had nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>The purpose of rate hikes was to curb inflation, but the cost was economic recession. The hardest-hit groups:<br>First, the real estate market: 30-year mortgage rates rose from 3% to 7%, monthly payments increased 40-50%, home sales plummeted 30%, construction workers lost jobs en masse.<br>Second, the tech sector: Meta laid off 11,000, Amazon 27,000, Google 12,000—total 150,000 tech workers unemployed.<br>Third, small businesses: loan rates soared, consumer demand withered, failure rates rose 50%.<br>Fourth, wage earners: unemployment rose from 3.5% to 3.8%, hourly wage growth slowed, credit card default rates rose.</p>
<p>Remember barista Maria? March 2023, Third Wave café closed. She lost her job. Her financial situation? Savings: zero, long gone. Credit card debt: $4,200, interest rate up from 14% to 21%. Student loans: $28,000. Monthly income: zero. She applied for unemployment benefits: $450 per week. But rent had risen to $1,050 per month. Basic monthly expenses ~$1,800. Monthly unemployment ~$1,800. Surplus $200. She still had to make the minimum credit card payment of $150&#x2F;month. She was left with $50 per month for transportation, medical, food, and socializing.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of moving back to Mexico,” she tells a friend. “I can’t survive here anymore.”</p>
<p>This is the ultimate irony of the Cantillon Effect: In 2020, the Fed printed 5 trillion to save the economy, Wall Street made a fortune, the rich saw assets soar 35%. In 2022, the Fed hiked rates to curb inflation, Maria became unemployed and fell into poverty. She wasn’t there for the benefits, but she was there to pay the bill.</p>
<p>September 2023. As a physical banknote, my physical form was severely worn. Over two years, I underwent hundreds of transactions, touched by dozens of hands, folded in wallets, crushed in cash registers, crumpled in pockets. My corners were torn, Washington’s face blurred, the serial number nearly illegible, a two-centimeter tear on the right side, overall yellowed and soft.</p>
<p>The last time, a homeless man used me to buy a bottle of water at a convenience store. The cashier looked at me, frowned, but still accepted me. That night, the store owner deposited the day’s cash into the night safe. The next day, the bank’s armored truck came to collect.</p>
<p>Ah, my life. Under the scanner of a Chase Bank bill counter, I was judged: Serial L92047856G, issue date November 2019, circulation time three years ten months, condition assessment: unfit for circulation. Final status: multiple tears, severe soiling, structural integrity failed. Recommendation: Recycle and destroy. Destination: Federal Reserve Bank Currency Destruction Center.</p>
<p>I was removed from fit currency and placed with other damaged bills into a bag labeled “Mutilated Currency.” A week later, I arrived at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, close to my birthplace.</p>
<p>The basement, Currency Destruction Center. Huge machines roar. Thousands of damaged bills move on a conveyor belt. I see my siblings, some more torn than me, some still somewhat intact, but all reaching life’s end. The shredder activates. A violent tearing sensation, I’m cut into hair-thin strips. These shreds are compressed into briquettes. Some will be used for building materials, some turned into souvenirs, some go to landfills.</p>
<p>My physical form vanished completely. But the story isn’t over.</p>
<p>Remember? I am essentially digital currency, just occasionally wearing a physical coat. My true self remained in the digital world.</p>
<p>October 2023, after the convenience store owner’s deposit, I (my digital self) entered Chase Bank’s system. The bank invested me and other deposits into a money market fund. The money market fund used me to buy short-term Treasuries (three-month). This batch of Treasuries was precisely the three-year notes issued in March 2020, now nearing maturity. And this batch was the very one the Fed bought via quantitative easing.</p>
<p>November 2024, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction plan, quantitative tightening, was still ongoing. Each month, the Fed let 60 billion dollars in Treasuries mature without reinvestment.</p>
<p>The trade record shows: Date November 15, 2024; maturing U.S. Treasury bills, face value 50 billion dollars; Holder: Federal Reserve System. Operation: Redeem, no reinvestment of this batch. The Treasury paid the Fed 50 billion dollars in principal and interest. This money returned to the Fed’s account and was then deleted.</p>
<p>The Fed’s balance sheet: Assets—U.S. Treasury holdings decreased by 50 billion dollars. Liabilities—Bank reserves decreased by 50 billion dollars. The monetary base shrank by 50 billion dollars. Me and my 4.999999999 billion siblings were thus erased from the digital world. No burning, no shredder. Just a database operation. I vanished, as silently as I was born.</p>
<p>From March 23, 2020, to November 15, 2024, I existed for four years, seven months, and twenty-three days.</p>
<p>Now, let’s review this journey and reveal the core secrets of the modern monetary system.</p>
<p><strong>First: The birth of money is the digitization of debt.</strong> Folks, I am not money. I am a symbol of credit. My birth chain is this: The government needs money, creating a budget deficit; the government issues Treasury bonds (the government’s IOUs); Wall Street buys the bonds in the primary market; the Fed buys the bonds with digitally created currency; then, I am born. Essentially, modern money &#x3D; government debt × central bank credit. It has no gold, no silver, no physical backing whatsoever. It’s backed only by the U.S. government’s promise to repay its debt, the Fed’s promise that these digits can be exchanged for goods, and the global consensus that dollars can buy things. If any of these three collapses, the dollar collapses.</p>
<p><strong>Second: The Cantillon Effect creates inequality in money distribution.</strong> The closer you are to the printing press, the sooner you benefit; the farther you are, the later you suffer. Centimeters: The Fed gets money instantly, infinite purchasing power. Ten meters: Wall Street gets money within a week, assets just starting to rise, wealth can increase 50% to 100%. One hundred meters: Hedge funds and the wealthy get money in 1-3 months, assets already up 20%, wealth can increase 20% to 100%. One kilometer: Middle-class asset holders feel asset appreciation 6-12 months later, assets up 40%, wealth grows 5% to 30%. Ten kilometers: Small business owners get money 12-18 months later, assets up 50%, but profits are squeezed. One hundred kilometers: Wage earners feel the change 18-24 months later, assets up 60%, but real purchasing power falls 10%.</p>
<p>Look again at Maria’s tragedy: wage increase 7.7%, living cost increase 18%, real loss 10.3%. And Mr. Chen’s comedy? His assets up 35.5%, living costs up 18%, but as a small portion, real gain ~30%. Same inflation, completely different fates.</p>
<p><strong>Third: Dollar hegemony is a triple-loop perpetual motion machine.</strong><br>Loop 1: Domestic loop. Budget deficit leads to debt issuance; debt issuance leads to Fed QE; QE leads to money creation; money creation flows into financial markets, pushing up asset prices, creating a wealth effect; the wealth effect boosts consumption, leading to economic growth and higher tax revenue; but the deficit grows larger, so more debt is issued. Rinse and repeat.<br>Loop 2: International loop. The U.S. imports goods, dollars flow out; foreign countries earn dollars; foreign central banks reserve dollars, buying U.S. bonds and stocks; dollars flow back to the U.S., used for more imports. Again, rinse and repeat.<br>Loop 3: Financial loop. The Fed prints base money; bank credit expands; under the money multiplier effect, broad money M2 increases tenfold, pushing up asset prices; collateral升值 leads to more credit; the bubble inflates until it bursts; the Fed performs QE to rescue the market. And so the cycle goes.</p>
<p>The core of these three loops: The U.S. can buy global goods with printed money; the world must hold dollar assets because trade is settled in dollars; the biggest market for dollar assets is the U.S., so dollars always flow back to the U.S.</p>
<p>The only weakness of this system, folks, is confidence. If one day, U.S. government credit collapses (e.g., debt default), or Fed credit collapses (e.g., hyperinflation), or global consensus collapses (de-dollarization begins), then the whole system will collapse.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth: Bit and Atom: The dual universe of money.</strong> In the modern economy, money exists simultaneously in two dimensions. In the bit-world, the digital world, money makes up 99.9% of the total. It can cross the globe instantly, is infinitely divisible, has no weight, no form, exists in bank servers. In the atom-world, the physical world, money is only 0.1% of the total. It is subject to physical limits, has transportation and storage costs, the smallest unit is one cent, has weight and wears out, exists in wallets and cash registers.</p>
<p>I shuttled between these two worlds: My origin was in the bit-world (Fed’s database). When I was withdrawn, I went from bit to atom. When circulating, it was atom-to-atom transfer. When deposited, I went from atom back to bit. When invested, it was bit-to-bit. When destroyed, atoms were shredded, or bits were deleted by quantitative tightening.</p>
<p>The key insight: Physical currency is just the manifestation of digital currency. They are fundamentally the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth: The essence of inflation is time-arbitrage.</strong> Why does inflation cause inequality? Because not all prices rise at the same time. Let’s look at the sequence of price increases from 2020 to 2023: April-June 2020, stocks up 40%; July-September 2020, real estate up 15%; October-December 2020, commodities up 30%; January-June 2021, energy up 80%; July-December 2021, food up 35%; January-June 2022, rent up 25%; July-December 2022, services up 20%; Full-year 2023, wages finally up 8%.</p>
<p>See? People holding stocks benefited as early as April 2020. Wage earners didn’t see wage increases until 2023, but everything else had been rising for two years already. This time lag is the mechanism of wealth transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth: The truth of quantitative tightening is the eternal cycle of money.</strong> In 2024, the Fed did QT, I was deleted. But this is not the end. In 2025, when the next crisis hits—a stock market crash, bank failures, geopolitical conflict, economic recession—the Fed will restart QE. A new “me” will be created, repeating the same cycle. The monetary system is an eternal cycle: Boom, excessive leverage, bubble, crash, QE rescue, inflation, rate hikes, recession, QE rescue, boom… Each cycle, debt is higher, asset price baselines are higher, the wealth gap is larger, ordinary people’s real purchasing power is lower. Until one day, this system can no longer be sustained. What will happen then? Debt reset? Hyperinflation? A new monetary system? Social revolution? No one knows. But history tells us no monetary system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Finally, as investors, what macro investment frameworks can we derive from the story of <em>The Quantum Life of a Dollar</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Core Insight 1: Understand the monetary cycle.</strong> The monetary cycle is the Fed’s policy cycle. It should be your investment clock. In the QE phase (Fed prints, buys bonds), stocks, bonds, commodities all rise. You should be fully invested in risk assets. In the early rate-hike phase (Fed tightens liquidity), stocks churn, bonds fall. You should reduce positions, hold cash. In the late rate-hike phase (Fed hikes aggressively), stocks and bonds fall. You should short, hold cash, or buy gold. In the pause phase (Fed on hold), markets bounce. You can start building positions gradually. When the Fed cuts rates, easing liquidity, a new bull market arrives. You should be fully invested again.</p>
<p><strong>Core Insight 2: Cantillon Effect Investing.</strong> In a monetary easing cycle, buy assets closest to the printing press: financial stocks, bank stocks (first beneficiaries), tech stocks (high growth loves cheap money), real estate (direct beneficiary of low rates), and cryptocurrencies (the狂欢 of liquidity泛滥). In a monetary tightening cycle, buy assets that get hurt last: consumer staples (Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, rigid demand), healthcare (pharma, medical devices, non-cyclical), utilities (electricity, water, stable cash flow), and Treasuries, cash (the ultimate safe havens).</p>
<p><strong>Core Insight 3: Quantitative investment strategy.</strong> Watch inflation data, unemployment, the 10-year Treasury yield. If CPI falls, unemployment rises, expect rate cuts—go long. If CPI rises, unemployment low, expect rate hikes—short or wait. Also watch the health of the Treasury market (10-year yield and 2s-10s spread). If the spread is negative (yield curve inverted), that’s a recession warning. If spread &gt; 0.5 (curve steepening), it suggests possible economic recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Core Insight 4: The core of long-term investing is to buy in crisis, sell in euphoria.</strong> March 2020 pandemic crash, S&amp;P 500 at 2,300; end of 2021, everything-in bubble, S&amp;P 500 at 4,800. If you bought in March, sold in December, you could have made 108%. Sadly, 99% of people did the opposite: they sold in panic in March, then FOMO-bought in December. Long-term investing isn’t about buying blue chips and forgetting them. It’s buying assets that benefit most in easing cycles and get hurt least in tightening cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Core Insight 5: Always remember Maria.</strong> Investing isn’t just about making money; it’s about understanding the world. The story of a dollar tells us: The monetary system is a wealth redistribution mechanism. The beneficiaries of money printing are asset holders; the victims are wage earners. Inflation is not a natural phenomenon; it’s a policy choice. By choosing to print money, the government chooses inflation, and thus chooses wealth transfer. The market is not neutral; it’s biased. It favors capital over labor, finance over the real economy, the rich over the poor.</p>
<p>When you make money, remember it’s partly systemic advantage, not just your skill. When you lose money, remember it’s partly systemic risk, not just your mistake. Most importantly, folks, understand the rules of the game, don’t just complain about unfairness. Maria did nothing wrong. She worked hard, lived frugally, but she was in a game stacked against her.</p>
<p>Some morning in 2026, Washington D.C. The Treasury Secretary announces at a press conference, “Given slowing economic growth, we will issue a new round of Treasury bonds, size 2 trillion dollars.” The New York Fed trading floor, a trader’s fingers hover over the keyboard. The screen flashes an instruction: “Federal Reserve System, quantitative easing program restart, awaiting authorization.”</p>
<p>Somewhere, a new “one dollar” is about to be born. Will he journey the same path I did? Or witness a different world? No one knows. But as long as this monetary system keeps running, as long as debt keeps growing, as long as the Fed has the power to print, there will be countless “me”s swirling in the void, flowing through the economy, leaping in finance, wearing down in the physical world, perishing in data.</p>
<p>This is the quantum life of a dollar, and the eternal cycle of the modern monetary system.</p>

          <p>今天咱们要聊的这个话题，可能听起来有点玄乎，叫做《一美元的量子人生》。你可能觉得，一块钱能有什么可聊的？量子跟我有关系吗？别急，我不是要给你讲物理，我要给你揭示的是，隐藏在你口袋里这小小一块钱背后，那个你从未看过的巨大秘密。这个秘密直接决定了咱们的贫富差距，决定了全球经济的兴衰，甚至决定了咱们每一个人在社会这个大赌场里，到底能分到几张筹码。</p>
<p>咱们就从一个看似遥远却跟我们息息相关的场景开始说起。2020年3月18号，华盛顿特区，美国财政部的部长姆努钦在开一个紧急视频会议，屏幕那头是国会预算委员会一众焦虑不安的脸。姆努钦说：“我们需要两点三万亿美元。”这距离疫情爆发才过了两周，三百五十万人申请失业救济，医疗系统眼看就要崩溃，小企业大片大片地倒闭。钱要从哪里来？失业救济、企业补贴、给每个美国人发现金，还有医疗支出。有人弱弱地问了句：“增税？”姆努钦摇了摇头：“来不及，而且经济衰退的时候增税无异于自杀。只有一个法子：发债。”</p>
<p>发债这事儿美国政府每年都干。2019年，联邦政府收入三点五万亿，支出四点四万亿，赤字九千亿，这窟窿就是靠发债补的。但2020年那会儿，疫情一来，赤字规模直接爆炸了。3月20号，美国财政部宣布，未来三个月将发行三万亿美元的新国债，这直接是历史记录。接着第一批参数定下来了：十年期国债，票面利率零点六二五，发行规模五百亿美元。</p>
<p>3月23号上午十一点，一级市场拍卖。这个时候，视角转到地球另外一边，纽约曼哈顿，摩根大通的交易大厅。落地窗外街上空荡荡的，交易员们都在家里远程办公。交易主管在Zoom会议上说：“财政部周一要拍卖五百亿的十年期国债，咱们是一级交易商，必须得参与竞标。”</p>
<p>你听好了，一级交易商，这是个特权阶级。这是美联储亲自认证的二十四家机构，像高盛、摩根大通、花旗、美国银行，还有法国巴黎、德意志、汇丰、野村、巴克莱等等。他们是美国国债发行机制的核心。这些一级交易商有什么特权和义务呢？义务就是，财政部每一次国债拍卖，他们都必须参与，提供流动性。而特权就是，他们可以直接从美联储借钱，也可以直接把债券卖给美联储。</p>
<p>摩根大通的首席交易员一边盯着Excel表格，一边计算着：“咱们准备竞标五十亿，预计收益率零点六八，价格九十九点六二。如果中标了，当天就得支付五十亿美金。”钱从哪里来？有人问。“先用咱们的资本金垫付，拍下来之后立刻分销给客户，养老金、保险公司、对冲基金。”或者，他顿了一下，眼睛扫过所有人，“或者卖给美联储。”</p>
<p>会议室里突然安静下来，所有人都明白这家伙在暗示什么。</p>
<p>3月23号上午十一点，纽约联储的电子拍卖系统开始运作。二十四家一级交易商的交易员坐在家里电脑前，手指在键盘上飞舞。系统跳出拍卖信息：美国十年期国债，发行量五百亿美元，票面利率零点六二五，2030年3月31号到期。竞标从十一点开始，十一点半结束。每家机构都输入自己愿意接受的价格和数量：摩根大通，五十亿，价格九十九点五八；高盛，四十五亿，价格九十九点六零；花旗，四十亿，价格九十九点五五……</p>
<p>十一点二十九分五十秒，最后十秒钟，修改价格的交易员手指快得像在跳舞。咔嚓，十一点三十整，竞标关闭，系统开始计算。三十秒后，结果公布：总竞标金额一千二百七十三亿美元，最终分配五百亿美元，认购倍数二点五五倍，最高收益率零点六八五，最低收益率零点六五八。一级交易商拿走了百分之十八点二。成交！</p>
<p>摩根大通分配到了五十亿美元的国债。财政部的TGA账户，也就是存在纽约联储的那个账户，立刻收到了五百亿美元现金。财政部官员看着账户余额跳动，长舒了一口气。这笔钱会在四十八小时内流向各州失业保险系统，支付失业救济金；流向小企业管理局，用于PPP贷款计划；流向美国国税局，给每个美国成年人发一千二百美元的刺激支票；还有卫生部，采购呼吸机和防护设备。</p>
<p>但摩根大通的交易主管们盯着屏幕，眉头紧锁。他们刚刚支付了五十亿美元，拿到了五十亿美元的国债，账上现金大笔大笔地减少。客户还没来得及接手这批债券，流动性缺口，五十亿美元。换做平时，这根本不是问题，债券很快会分销给养老金、保险公司、外国央行，现金很快就能回笼。但2020年3月不是平时，市场恐慌，股市暴跌，信用市场冻结，所有机构都在囤积现金，谁也不想买资产。</p>
<p>“我们必须把这些国债卖出去，”CFO说，“不然咱们的资本充足率就要出问题了。”</p>
<p>卖给谁？所有人的目光再次投向了同一个方向：美联储。</p>
<p>同一天下午两点，美联储的交易大厅。纽约联储的交易主管走进几乎空无一人的大厅，按下了桌上的红色按钮。巨大的屏幕亮起，显示着美联储主席鲍威尔的实时指令：“联邦储备系统，量化宽松无限量，扭曲操作授权。购买无限量美国国债，对所有一级交易商，二十四家机构。目标：确保市场流动性和正常运作。即刻生效。美联储主席，杰罗姆·鲍威尔。”</p>
<p>这是人类货币史上前所未有的时刻。“无限量”量化宽松，不是一千亿，不是五千亿，是无限！</p>
<p>交易员坐下来，打开购买系统，设置好参数。购买程序激活：目标美国国债，所有期限；每日购买限额，无上限；价格，市场价加零点零五；自动成交。</p>
<p>是！摩根大通的交易员看到了美联储的买单，眼睛一亮。他立刻挂出卖单：五十亿美元十年期国债，收益率零点六七，及时交割。美联储系统自动匹配，自动成交。一瞬间，两件事同时发生：</p>
<p>第一，摩根大通的账户，也就是他们存在纽约联储的准备金账户，之前余额四百五十二点三亿美元。交易增加了五十亿美元（是美联储购买了十年期国债），新余额五百零二点三亿美元。</p>
<p>第二，美联储的资产负债表，在资产项下，美国国债增加了五十亿美元；在负债项下，银行准备金增加了五十亿美元。</p>
<p>你看，没有运钞车，没有印钞机，更没有金库，只有一个操作员在键盘上敲下指令，在数据库中更新数字。我和我的四十九点九九九九九亿兄弟姐妹，就在这一刻凭空诞生了。</p>
<p>我只是其中的一美元，序列号QE4-2020-0323-B7F9。我是纯粹的数字，存在于美联储的服务器中，是摩根大通准备金账户里的一个比特。我没有物理形态，没有重量，没有颜色。但我有价值，因为美联储说我有，因为美国政府的信用支撑着我，因为全世界相信我。</p>
<p>摩根大通的资产负债表上，准备金从四百五十亿骤增到五百零二亿。第二天早上的高管会议上，首席财务官说：“我们账上多了五十亿流动性。美联储还在继续买债，市场上到处都是钱。这些准备金存在美联储只有百分之零点一的利息，我们必须把它投出去。”</p>
<p>首席投资官接口：“股市刚崩了百分之三十，现在是抄底的黄金时机。”</p>
<p>各位，这就是“坎蒂隆效应”的起点。十八世纪的时候，爱尔兰籍的法国经济学家理查德·坎蒂隆发现了一个秘密。他说，当新的货币进入经济系统的时候，不是所有人同时都能得到这笔钱。最先拿到新钱的人，可以用旧的价格去购买资产。而当新钱流遍了整个经济体，物价普遍上涨之后，最后拿到钱的人，就只能用新的、更高的价格去买东西了。换句话说，印钞的受益者，取决于你离印钞机到底有多近。</p>
<p>2020年3月，美联储印了五万亿美元。那么，谁离印钞机最近呢？</p>
<p>首先，零米，是美联储本身，他们凭空创造货币，购买力无限。<br>其次，十米，是二十四家一级交易商，摩根大通就在这里，他们直接从美联储拿到了新钱，而这个时候资产价格还没来得及上涨。当然，我现在就在这里。<br>然后，一百米，是对冲基金、私募和各种大投资者，他们从一级交易商手里拿钱，这个时候资产价格才刚刚开始上涨，但涨幅有限。<br>然后，一公里，是大企业、上市公司，他们可以从金融市场融资，这个时候资产价格已经涨了一些，但他们可以通过发债、发股票来融资。<br>然后，十公里，是中小企业主，他们从银行贷款，这个时候借贷成本已经开始上升了，竞争也变得激烈起来。<br>最后，一百公里，也就是坎蒂隆效应的末端，是普通的工薪阶层，他们依靠工资收入，而这个时候物价已经全面上涨，他们的工资涨幅远远地低于通胀。</p>
<p>摩根大通把包括我在内的五十亿美元迅速部署了出去。<br>最先，是股票抄底，二十亿美元。股票交易主管说：“纳斯达克从九千点跌到六千五百点，跌了百分之二十八。买入科技股：苹果、微软、亚马逊、特斯拉。”3月23号，这些股票的价格都还很便宜。<br>然后，是公司债券，十五亿美元。固定收益主管说：“投资级的公司在收益率飙到百分之六，垃圾债在百分之十。美联储已经暗示会买公司债，风险有限，收益可观。”他们买入了波音、达美航空、嘉年华游轮的债券。<br>接着，是私募股权，十亿美元，投资给了KKR的杠杆收购基金、黑石的房地产基金，还有桥水的全天候策略。<br>最后，是五亿美元，被投入到十家基金。</p>
<p>我是在这里，被分配到了CTD Capital，一家顶级的量化对冲基金。CTD Capital的交易算法接收到了资金注入信号，立刻开始运作。我和其他数亿美元被部署到：百分之六十投入到股票多头，做多科技股AI、做多电动车特斯拉、蔚来，做多云计算Snowflake、Datadog；百分之二十投入到期权交易，买入看涨期权，利用十到二十倍的杠杆；百分之十投入到加密货币市场，通过Coinbase、MicroStrategy间接投资比特币；最后百分之十留作现金，等待更好的入场时机。</p>
<p>三个月后，奇迹发生了。2020年3月到6月，在疫情最严重、失业率暴涨的时候，美股开始了令人瞠目结舌的反弹：特斯拉从八十六块涨到了二百一十五块，涨幅百分之一百五十；苹果涨了百分之六十三；亚马逊涨了百分之四十三；Zoom涨了百分之一百二十五；纳斯达克指数从低点反弹了百分之四十。CTD Capital基金三个月收益达到百分之三十七。我原本的一美元，在账面上变成了百分之一点三七美元。</p>
<p>CNBC的主持人困惑地说：“这不科学啊，失业率百分之二十，GDP萎缩，但股市却在创新高。”一位对冲基金经理在采访中说：“这非常科学。美联储印了五万亿美元，这些钱要去哪？当然是资产，股票、债券、房产、比特币。千万别和美联储作对。”</p>
<p>坎蒂隆效应的第一阶段已经完成：金融资产持有者财富暴涨，工薪阶层失业或降薪，贫富差距以史上最快的速度拉大。</p>
<p>我这一美元，诞生于2020年3月23号。仅仅六个月后，就已经创造出了对冲基金的管理费（百分之二）、业绩提成（百分之二十的收益分成）、股票升值的资本利得，还有期权交易的杠杆收益等等。但这些收益全部流向了金融系统的内部人。而失业的餐厅服务员、破产的小企业主、被房东驱逐的租客，他们一分钱都没落着。</p>
<p>更残酷的是，当通胀真正来临的时候，他们将成为最大的受害者。《金融时报》在2020年八月发表了一篇报道：美国亿万富翁的总财富在疫情期间增加了五千六百一十亿美元，涨幅百分之四十九。同期，四千万人失业，一千二百万人失去医疗保险。原因是什么？亿万富翁的财富大多在股票、房地产、企业股权里，而美联储印的五万亿，直接推高了这些资产的价格。普通人的财富主要在工资里，一旦失业或者降薪，没有资产的他们，就无法分享到印钞的红利。</p>
<p>2020年九月，全球经济开始复苏，中国率先从疫情中走出，工厂开工，出口激增。CTD Capital决定重新配置资产，减持一部分美股，转向中国科技股的ADR，也就是美国存托凭证。我和其他资金都被用来购买了阿里巴巴、腾讯、拼多多的美股ADR。这些公司在中国运营，需要将部分资金汇回国内，用于业务的扩张，比如建数据中心、投资研发、收购企业等等。</p>
<p>跨境支付系统SWIFT立刻启动。系统记录：从花旗银行纽约分行，到中国银行深圳分行，金额十亿美元，受益人阿里巴巴集团控股有限公司，备注是“菜鸟物流扩建的资本注入”。我从纽约的花旗银行账户，通过SWIFT网络，流向香港的汇丰银行，再到深圳的中国银行。</p>
<p>在香港的深圳的外汇市场，我又换了一次装。在即期外汇交易中，十亿美元被卖出，买入六十八亿人民币，汇率是六点八。我被兑换成了人民币。更准确地说，我的美元身份被转移给了卖出人民币的一方，也就是中国央行通过商业银行操作。我进入了中国人民银行的外汇储备，那是一个庞大的数字海洋，三点二万亿美元，全球最大的外汇储备。</p>
<p>我静静地躺在中国人民银行资产负债表的外汇资产科目下，成为了十四亿中国人手中人民币的信用背书。这揭示了一个秘密：过去人民币的发行机制，也就是2015年之前的主导模式是，中国出口商品到美国，赚取美元；出口商在中国银行兑换美元，换成人民币；商业银行再把美元卖给央行，央行支付人民币给商业银行。所以，央行印钞的依据就是外汇储备的增加。这意味着，中国持有三点二万亿美元外储，大约对应的是二十二万亿人民币的发行。美元是人民币的“锚”。</p>
<p>中国人民银行的外汇储备管理部门每天都要面对一个两难的选择：三点二万亿美元不能闲置，必须投资保值增值。我究竟投什么呢？</p>
<p>方案一，美国国债。这是最安全的。它的优点是名义上的AAA评级，流动性无敌，而且是美元计价。缺点就是收益率只有零点七，跑不赢通胀。<br>方案二，美国股票。优点是长期回报高。缺点是政治敏感，比如说“中国政府控制美国企业”，而且波动很大。<br>方案三，欧洲或者日本的资产。优点是分散风险。缺点说，日元也在贬值，收益率更低。<br>方案四，黄金、大宗商品。优点是抗通胀。缺点是不生息，储存成本高。<br>方案五，“一带一路”投资。优点是支持国家战略。缺点是风险高，很多项目都亏损了。</p>
<p>所以你会发现，最终现实的选择是，中国的外汇储备资产，根据2020年的数据：百分之六十到六十五是美国国债；百分之五到八是美国机构债；百分之三到五是美国股票（通过主权基金持有）；百分之十五到二十是欧元资产；百分之五是日元资产；另外百分之五是其他，比如说黄金、SDR和新兴市场债券。</p>
<p>结论就是，无论中国愿不愿意，都必须大量地持有美元资产。这就是美元霸权的本质。</p>
<p>2020年十一月，美国大选结束，拜登当选。市场预期会有一轮新的财政刺激。中国央行外汇管理部门发出指令：购买一百亿美元十年期美国国债，锁定当前较低的收益率。但注意了，我们不是从美国财政部直接买债，交易是通过纽约联储的代理账户，在二级市场进行的。卖家是一家华尔街的对冲基金：桥水（Bridgewater）。他们当时正在重新配置资产。</p>
<p>交易确认单显示：日期是2020年11月15号；证券是十年期美国国债，利率零点六二五，2030年到期；金额一百亿美元；价格九十九点四五；收益率零点七二。买家是中国人民银行通过纽约联储的托管账户，卖家是桥水资产管理公司通过摩根大通的托管账户。结算时间是T加一，也就是2020年11月16号。</p>
<p>资金的流向是：中国央行账户到纽约联储托管账户，到摩根大通，到桥水账户。所以你看，我就是从中国央行流向了桥水。国债的流向就是：桥水托管账户到纽约联储托管系统，到中国央行托管账户。</p>
<p>这里有几个关键的洞察：<br>第一点，中国买了美债，但美元并没有锁死，美元继续在美国金融系统里流通，只是国债的所有权换了主人。<br>第二点，二级市场的流动性是美债信用的基石。美国国债每天的交易量有六千到七千亿美元，各国央行随时都可以买卖，这种流动性维护了美元的储备货币地位。<br>第三点，美国获得了双重的好处：卖家桥水拿到了一百亿美元，可以投资美国经济；买家中国央行帮助稳定了美债价格，实际上是压低了收益率。</p>
<p>桥水拿到了包括我在内的一百亿美元。创始人瑞·达利欧在内部会议上说：“美联储印钞，通胀必然会来。我们要配置百分之四十的通胀保值资产，比如TIPS、大宗商品和黄金；百分之三十的股票，比如能源、材料和金融；百分之二十的新兴市场；还有百分之十的现金。”</p>
<p>我被分配到了股票账户，具体投向了能源股埃克森美孚。2020年十一月，埃克森美孚的股价是三十三美元。2021年六月，埃克森美孚的股价涨到了六十三美元，涨幅百分之九十一。我又增值了。</p>
<p>但各位，这次增值和第一次不同。第一次，也就是2020年3月到6月，那是恐慌后的反弹，是流动性泛滥。而第二次，2020年11月到2021年6月，则是通胀预期，是实体经济开始感受到货币增发的影响。能源价格在涨，原材料价格在涨，运输成本在涨，通胀的火焰开始从金融市场蔓延到实体经济。</p>
<p>2021年四月，一个转折点来了。埃克森美孚宣布分红，桥水获得了部分现金回报。我和其他资金流回了基金的现金账户。</p>
<p>与此同时，一个叫奥马尔的沙特留学生正在南加州大学读MBA。他的父亲是沙特阿美石油公司的高管，刚刚收到了巨额的奖金，因为油价从2020年的低点反弹了百分之三百。父亲给奥马尔汇款五千美元生活费。</p>
<p>资金的路径是：沙特国家银行利雅得分行，通过SWIFT到沙特国家银行纽约分行，再通过美国国内转账，到了奥马尔在洛杉矶的美国银行账户。这五千美元的一部分，最终追溯起来，源自沙特主权基金PIF的流动性池，而PIF的部分资金投资了桥水。</p>
<p>于是，我成为了奥马尔账户里的一美元。</p>
<p>2021年4月15号，洛杉矶世纪城的一家美国银行网点。奥马尔走到ATM机前，插入银行卡，输入密码，选择取现一百美元，确认。ATM内部机械装置开始运作。</p>
<p>交易记录显示：日期2021年4月15号，下午两点三十二分十七秒；账户是奥马尔的账户；交易是现金取款，金额一百美元。</p>
<p>数字步骤：验证账户余额，五千零二十七点八九美元；扣除金额，余额五千一百四十七点八九美元；更新账本，完成；授权发放一百美元。</p>
<p>物理步骤：二号钞盒，一百美元纸币；放出一百张钞票；验证器扫描序列号；钞票吐出口，交付。</p>
<p>从钞箱里，一百张一美元纸币被机械臂调出，整理，送到了出钞口。其中一张序列号是L92047856G，印刷于2019年11月，已经流通了一年半。这就是我。</p>
<p>我第一次有了物理形态，从数据库中的一行记录，变成了一张有尺寸、有重量、有材质、有颜色、有图案的实实在在的纸币。我从比特变成了原子。</p>
<p>奥马尔把我和其他纸币塞进了钱包，走出了银行，开车前往圣莫尼卡。奥马尔走进这家网红咖啡店，他记得去年，也就是2020年的时候来过一次，一杯手冲咖啡只要三块五美元。他看向菜单板：2021年4月的菜单，单品手冲咖啡，四块五美元，涨了；拿铁，五块二五美元，也涨了；卡布奇诺，五块钱，涨了；科尔塔朵，四块七五美元，还涨了。下方还有小字备注：“价格上涨是因为成本上升。”</p>
<p>涨价了？奥马尔问咖啡师。咖啡师玛利亚，一个疲惫的二十六岁墨西哥移民，笑着说：“是的，老板说成本涨太多了，不涨价就要关门了。”</p>
<p>咱们来盘点一下这家咖啡店的成本变化就知道了：2020年3月，一磅埃塞俄比亚的咖啡豆，十二美元；到2021年4月，涨到了十六美元，涨幅百分之三十三。牛奶的涨幅，百分之二十一。店面租金涨了百分之八。员工工资，最低工资从每小时十三美元涨到了十四美元，涨幅百分之七点七。水电煤气涨了百分之十一。包装耗材，比如纸杯盖子，从十二美分一个涨到了十八美分一个，涨幅高达百分之五十。平均的成本涨幅大约了百分之二十二。但菜单价格只涨了百分之二十八，这意味着利润空间被严重地压缩。“我们已经是第三次涨价了，”老板卡洛斯在后厨叹气，“再涨价客人就不来了，但不涨价就亏钱。”</p>
<p>奥马尔点了一杯手冲，支付了四块五美元。我和其他三张一美元的纸币以及两个二毛五美分的硬币，被玛利亚放进了收银机。</p>
<p>当晚，玛利亚结束了八小时的轮班。她计算着这个月的收入：时薪十四美元，比去年涨了一块，涨幅百分之七点七；工时每周三十五小时（老板为了降低成本削减了工时）。月收入扣除税和社保后，到手大约一千七百美元。</p>
<p>她的支出呢？房租（合租一套公寓里的一个房间），从八百美元涨到九百美元，涨幅百分之十二点五。食品（超市加外食），从三百五十美元涨到四百八十美元，涨幅百分之三十七。交通（公交加打车），涨了百分之二十。水电煤气网费分摊，涨了百分之二十五。手机费涨了百分之十二点五。学生贷款，最低还款不变。医疗保险最低档涨了百分之七。总支出从一千七百美元涨到两千零五美元，涨幅百分之十八。</p>
<p>2020年3月的时候，玛利亚收入一千七百美元，支出一千七百美元，结余为零。而2021年4月，收入一千七百美元，支出两千零五美元，赤字三百零五美元。玛利亚看着银行账户余额，只有两百三十七美元。“我得找第二份工作，”她对室友说，“或者搬到更远的地方，但那样交通成本又会增加。”</p>
<p>这就是坎蒂隆效应的残酷末端。</p>
<p>咱们来整体看一下坎蒂隆效应的全景图，从2020年3月到2021年4月：<br>首先，美联储和一级交易商，他们在第一时间拿到了相应的五万亿美元，用旧价格购买了资产，财富增长了百分之二十到百分之一百。<br>其次，对冲基金、私募和富豪，他们在三到六个月后拿到钱，资产价格已经有所上涨但涨幅有限，财富增长了百分之二十到百分之一百。<br>然后，拥有股票或者房产的中产阶级，他们在六到十二个月后感受到了资产升值，但与此同时通胀也在上升，财富增长了百分之五到百分之三十。<br>接下来，小企业主，他们虽然拿到了PPP贷款，但成本暴涨，利润被压缩，财富增长只有百分之零到百分之十。<br>还有，工薪阶层，他们的工资涨幅百分之七点七，生活成本涨幅百分之十八，实际购买力下降了大百分之十。<br>最后，失业者和零工经济从业者，他们的收入大幅下降或者不稳定，生活成本暴涨，实际购买力下降了百分之二十到百分之五十。</p>
<p>第二天，玛利亚拿着我和其他几张现金去拉尔夫斯超市购物。她推着购物车，震惊地看着价格标签：鸡蛋一打，从两块九九涨到了四块二九，涨幅百分之四十三；牛奶一加仑，涨了百分之三十七；面包全麦的，涨了百分之三十二；鸡胸肉一磅，涨了百分之三十八；西兰花一磅，涨了百分之四十；食用油，涨了百分之五十；番茄一磅，涨了百分之五十四。</p>
<p>她的购物清单上原本有十二样东西，预算五十美元。但结账的时候，只买了八样，就已经花了五十二美元。她把我和其他现金递给了收银员。</p>
<p>我的购买力呢？2020年3月，我可以买两磅鸡肉，或者一打鸡蛋再加一盒麦片。而到了2021年4月，我只能买四分之一加仑的牛奶，或者半磅鸡肉。我在十三个月里贬值了大约百分之三十。</p>
<p>我从超市收银机里流入了超市老板的账户。随后，我被用于支付员工工资。员工何塞拿到工资后，支付房租给房东。我又回到了数字世界，从原子状态变回了比特状态。</p>
<p>房东陈先生是第一代的华裔移民，在洛杉矶拥有三套房产。他收到租金后，查看了他的投资账户：2020年3月，房产价值一百八十万美元，股票投资二十万美元，总资产两百万美元。2021年4月，房产价值两百四十万美元，涨了百分之三十三；股票投资三十一万美元，涨了百分之五十五；总资产两百七十一万美元，涨幅达到了百分之三十五点五。</p>
<p>他坐在客厅里喝着茶，感叹道：“我什么都没做，资产就涨了七十一万美元，这个国家真是疯了。”</p>
<p>楼下，玛利亚在她九百美元一个月的出租屋里，用计算器算着怎么熬过这个月。</p>
<p>各位，同样的通胀，对有资产的人来说是财富的增值，而对无资产的人来说，却是生存的危机。</p>
<p>接下来的两年，也就是2021年到2023年，我经历了多次比特和原子之间的转换：</p>
<p>2021年5月，原子变比特：陈先生把租金存入了大通银行，我从现金变成了银行账户里的数字。<br>2021年6月，比特变比特：陈先生用我投资股票，买入了英伟达。我从大通账户转到了富达投资账户。<br>2021年12月，比特变比特：英伟达股价涨了百分之八十，陈先生部分获利。我随着资金流入了一只房地产信托基金。<br>2022年3月，比特变比特：房地产信托基金分红了，陈先生提现了部分现金用于装修房产。我被自动取款机吐出，交给了装修工人卡洛斯。<br>2022年4月到8月，原子变原子：卡洛斯用我在家得宝买了材料，家得宝找零给了顾客沙拉；沙拉用我在农副市场买了有机蔬菜；农场主把我存入了银行。我在五个月里经历了实体世界的十二次交易。<br>2022年8月，原子变比特：农场主存款，我重回数字世界。<br>2022年9月到2023年6月，比特不停地变：农场主的银行把我借给小企业，小企业用我支付供应商，供应商存入另一家银行，银行又购买美国国债……我在金融系统里流转了九个月。</p>
<p>在这两年里，我以数字和实体两种形态，见证了：<br>在金融世界的比特形态里，我见证了加密货币的狂潮（比特币从一万美元涨到六万九千美元再跌到一万六千美元），NFT的泡沫（数字图片卖到几百万美元），科技股的崩盘（Meta跌了百分之七十，Netflix跌了百分之七十五），通胀数据飙升（消费者价格指数从百分之一点四涨到百分之九点一），美联储疯狂加息（利率从百分之零涨到百分之五点二五）。<br>而在实体世界的原子形态里，我见证了装修工人卡洛斯的工资涨了百分之十五，但房租却涨了百分之二十五；农副市场的有机番茄从四美元一磅涨到六点五美元一磅；家得宝的二乘四木材从三美元涨到八美元又回落到五美元；加油站的汽油从二点八美元一加仑涨到五点八美元一加仑；咖啡店Third Wave换了第三个老板，最后还是倒闭了。</p>
<p>各位，同一个我，在两个世界之间穿梭，见证了两个平行宇宙的剧烈震荡。</p>
<p>2022年三月，美联储启动了四十年来最激进的加息周期。联邦基金利率从2022年3月的百分之零点二五，到6月的百分之一点七五，再到9月的百分之三点二五，12月的百分之四点五，直到2023年7月的百分之五点五。每一次加息零点七五，都像一记重锤砸向金融市场。</p>
<p>我此时正在一个养老金账户里，投资于债券基金。债券价格和利率是反向关系的，当美联储把利率从百分之零点二五加到百分之五点五的时候，十年期国债的收益率从百分之零点七涨到了百分之四点八，债券价格暴跌了大约百分之四十。我的账面价值从一点三七美元跌回到了零点九五美元。</p>
<p>股市更是惨不忍睹：纳斯达克从高点跌了百分之三十五；特斯拉从一千二百美元跌到了一百零八美元，跌了百分之九十一；苹果从三百三十八美元跌到八十八美元，跌了百分之七十四。2022年，美股和美债同时暴跌，投资者真的是无处可逃。</p>
<p>加息的目的是遏制通胀，但代价是经济衰退。受伤最重的群体：<br>第一是房地产市场，三十年期房贷利率从百分之三涨到百分之七，月供增加了百分之四十到五十，房屋销售量暴跌百分之三十，建筑工人大量失业。<br>第二是科技行业，Meta裁员一万一千人，亚马逊裁员两万七千人，谷歌裁员一万两千人，总计十五万科技工人失业。<br>第三是小企业，贷款利率飙升，消费需求萎缩，倒闭率上升百分之五十。<br>第四是工薪阶层，失业率从百分之三点五升到百分之三点八，小时工资增长放缓，信用卡违约率上升。</p>
<p>还记得那个咖啡师玛利亚吗？2023年3月，Third Wave咖啡馆倒闭了，她失业了。她的财务状况呢？储蓄为零，早已用完；信用卡债务四千两百美元，利率从百分之十四涨到百分之二十一；学生贷款两万八千美元；月收入为零。她申请了失业救济，每周四百五十美元。但房租已经涨到一千零五十美元一个月，每月基本支出约一千八百美元。每月失业救济约一千八百美元，结余两百美元。她还要还信用卡最低还款一百五十美元一个月。她每个月只剩下五十美元用于交通、医疗、食物、社交。</p>
<p>“我在考虑搬回墨西哥，”她对朋友说，“在这里已经活不下去了。”</p>
<p>这就是坎蒂隆效应的终极讽刺：2020年美联储印了五万亿来救经济，华尔街赚得盆满钵满，富人资产暴涨百分之三十五。而2022年美联储加息遏制通胀，玛利亚失业陷入了贫困。受益的时候没她，买单的时候是她。</p>
<p>2023年九月，我作为实体纸币的我，物理形态已经极度破损了。我在两年里经历了数百次交易，被数十个人的手触摸过，在钱包里折叠，在收银机里挤压，在口袋里揉搓。我的四个角都有撕裂，华盛顿的脸已经模糊，序列号几乎看不清，右侧有一个两厘米的裂口，整体发黄发软。</p>
<p>最后一次，我被一个流浪汉用来在便利店买了一瓶水。收银员看着我，皱了皱眉，但还是收下了。当晚，便利店老板把一天的现金收入存入夜间保险箱。第二天，银行的运钞车来收款。</p>
<p>我的这一生啊，在大通银行的点钞机扫描下，被判定：序列号L92047856G，发行日期2019年11月，流通时间三年十个月，状况评估：不适宜流通。最后情况：撕裂多处，严重脏污，结构完整性失效。建议：回收销毁。目的地：联邦储备银行货币销毁中心。</p>
<p>我被从可流通纸币中剔除，和其他破损纸币一起装进了一个标有“破损货币”的袋子。一周后，我到达了旧金山联邦储备银行，距离我的诞生之地很近。</p>
<p>地下室，货币销毁中心，巨大的机器轰鸣着。成千上万张破损纸币在传送带上移动。我看到了我的兄弟姐妹们，有些比我更破，有些还算完整，但都走到了生命的终点。碎纸机启动了。一阵剧烈的撕裂，我被切成了细如发丝的碎片。这些碎片被压缩成砖块，一部分会被送去做建筑材料，一部分变成了纪念品，还有一部分去了垃圾填埋场。</p>
<p>我的物理形态彻底消失了。但故事还没有结束。</p>
<p>还记得吗？我本质上是数字货币，只是偶尔穿上了实体的外衣。我真正的本体仍然在数字世界中。</p>
<p>2023年十月，那个便利店老板存款后，我（也就是我的数字形态）进入了大通银行的系统。银行把我和其他存款投资于货币市场基金。货币市场基金用我购买了短期国债（三个月期的）。这批国债，正是2020年3月发行的三年期国债，现在即将到期。而这批国债，正是美联储通过量化宽松购买的那批。</p>
<p>2024年11月，美联储的缩表计划，也就是量化紧缩，还在持续进行中。每个月，美联储让六百亿美元的国债到期，不再续作。</p>
<p>交易记录显示：日期2024年11月15号，到期的美国国库券，面值五百亿美元，持有者：联邦储备系统。操作：赎回，不再对这批进行再投资。财政部向美联储支付了五百亿美元的本金和利息。这笔钱回到了美联储的账户，然后被删除。</p>
<p>美联储的资产负债表：资产中的美国国债减少五百亿美元，负债中的银行准备金减少五百亿美元。货币基础减少了五百亿美元。我和我的四十九点九九九九九九亿兄弟姐妹，就这样从数字世界中被抹除了。没有焚烧，没有碎纸机，只是数据库中的一次操作。我消失了，就像我诞生时一样，悄无声息。</p>
<p>从2020年3月23号，到2024年11月15号，我存在了四年七个月二十三天。</p>
<p>现在，咱们来回顾这段旅程，揭示现代货币体系的核心秘密：</p>
<p><strong>第一，货币的诞生是债务的数字化。</strong> 各位，我不是钱，我是信用的符号。我的诞生链条是这样的：政府需要钱，于是产生了财政赤字；政府发行国债（也就是政府的欠条）；华尔街购买了一级市场的国债；美联储用凭空创造的数字货币购买了国债；然后，我诞生了。本质上，现代货币 &#x3D; 政府债务 × 央行信用。它没有黄金，没有白银，没有任何实物来支撑。只有美国政府的承诺偿还债务的信用，美联储承诺这些数字可以交换商品的信用，以及全世界相信美元可以买东西的共识。当这三者中任何一个崩溃，美元就会崩溃。</p>
<p><strong>第二，坎蒂隆效应使货币分配的不平等。</strong> 离印钞机越近，你越早受益；离印钞机越远，你越晚受害。厘米的美联储及时拿到钱，购买力无限；十米的华尔街一周内拿到钱，资产刚开始涨，财富可以达到百分之五十到百分之一百；一百米远的对冲基金和富豪在一到三个月内拿到钱，资产已经涨了百分之二十，财富可以达到百分之二十到百分之一百；一公里远的中产资产持有人在六到十二个月后才感受到资产的升值，资产涨了百分之四十，财富增长了百分之五到百分之三十；十公里远的小企业主在十二到十八个月后才拿到钱，资产涨了百分之五十，但利润被挤压；一百公里远的工薪阶层在十八到二十四个月后才感受到变化，资产涨了百分之六十，但实际购买力却下降了百分之十。</p>
<p>再来看看玛利亚的悲剧：工资涨幅百分之七点七，生活成本涨幅却达到了百分之十八，实际损失了百分之十点三。而陈先生的喜剧呢？他的资产涨幅百分之三十五点五，生活成本涨幅百分之十八，但因为占比很小，实际收益高达百分之三十。同样的通胀，完全不同的命运。</p>
<p><strong>第三，美元霸权是一种三重循环的永动机。</strong><br>循环一：国内循环。财政赤字导致发债，发债导致美联储量化宽松，量化宽松导致货币创造，货币创造流入金融市场推动资产价格上涨产生财富效应，财富效应又推动了消费增加，从而带来经济增长和税收增加，但赤字更大了，于是发更多的债，周而复始。<br>循环二：国际循环。美国进口商品，美元流出；外国赚取美元，外国央行储备美元，购买美债美股；美元回流美国，继续进口。同样是周而复始。<br>循环三：金融循环。美联储印基础货币，银行信贷扩张，货币乘数作用下广义货币M2增加十倍，推动资产价格上涨，抵押品升值又带来更多的信贷；泡沫膨胀最后崩溃，美联储进行量化宽松救市。如此循环。</p>
<p>这三重循环的核心是：美国可以用印出来的钱购买全球的商品；全球必须持有美元资产，因为贸易都用美元结算；美元资产的最大市场就是美国，所以美元永远都会回流美国。</p>
<p>这个系统的唯一弱点，各位，是信心。如果有一天，美国政府信用崩溃（比如债务违约），或者美联储信用崩溃（比如恶性通胀），又或者全球共识崩溃（开始去美元化），那么整个系统就会坍塌。</p>
<p><strong>第四，比特与原子：货币的双重宇宙。</strong> 现代经济中，货币同时存在于两个维度。在比特世界，也就是数字世界里，货币占总量的百分之九十九点九。它可以瞬间跨越全球，无限可分，没有重量，没有形态，存在于银行服务器中。而在原子世界，也就是实体世界里，货币只占总量的百分之零点一。它受物理限制，有运输成本和存储成本，最小单位是一美分，有重量有磨损，存在于钱包收银机中。</p>
<p>我在两个世界之间穿梭：我的出身是在比特世界（美联储的数据库）；我被提现的时候，就从比特变原子；我在流通的时候，是原子和原子之间的流转；我被存款的时候，又从原子变比特；我在投资的时候，是比特到比特；我被销毁的时候，原子被碎纸机销毁，或者比特被量化紧缩删除。</p>
<p>关键的洞察是：实体货币只是数字货币的显化，它的本质是同一个东西。</p>
<p><strong>第五，通胀的本质是时间差套利。</strong> 为什么通胀会造成不平等？因为不是所有价格同时上涨。咱们来看看2020年到2023年价格上涨的顺序：2020年4月到6月，股票涨了百分之四十；7月到9月，房地产涨了百分之十五；10月到12月，大宗商品涨了百分之三十；2021年1月到6月，能源涨了百分之八十；7月到12月，食品涨了百分之三十五；2022年1月到6月，房租涨了百分之二十五；7月到12月，服务业涨了百分之二十；2023年全年，工资才涨了百分之八。</p>
<p>看明白了吗？拥有股票的人在2020年4月就受益了，而拿工资的人直到2023年才看到工资上涨，但其他东西已经涨了两年了。这个时间差就是财富转移的机制。</p>
<p><strong>第六，量化紧缩的真相是货币的永恒轮回。</strong> 2024年，美联储量化紧缩，我被删除了。但这不是结束。2025年，当下次危机来临的时候，比如股市崩盘、银行倒闭、地缘冲突、经济衰退，美联储会再次启动量化宽松。新的我会被创造出来，重复同样的循环。货币体系是一个永恒的轮回：繁荣，过度杠杆，泡沫，崩溃，量化宽松救市，通胀，加息，衰退，量化宽松救市，繁荣……每一次循环，债务更多，资产价格基线更高，贫富差距更大，普通人实际购买力更低。直到某一天，这个系统无法再维持。那时会发生什么？债务重置？恶性通胀？新货币体系？社会革命？没人知道。但历史告诉我们，没有永恒的货币体系。</p>
<p>最后，作为一个投资者，咱们能从《一美元的量子人生》这个故事里，得到哪些宏观投资框架呢？</p>
<p><strong>核心认知一：理解货币周期。</strong> 货币周期就是美联储的政策周期，它应该是你的投资时钟。在量化宽松阶段（美联储印钞买债），股票、债券、大宗商品都会上涨，这时候你应该满仓风险资产。在加息初期（美联储收紧流动性），股票震荡，债券下跌，你该减仓持币。在加息后期（美联储激进加息），股票债券下跌，你应该做空、持币或者买黄金。在暂停加息阶段（美联储观望），市场反弹，你可以分批建仓。等到美联储降息了，放松流动性，新一轮牛市又来了，你应该满仓。</p>
<p><strong>核心认知二：坎蒂隆效应投资法。</strong> 在货币宽松周期，你应该买那些离印钞机最近的资产，比如金融股、银行股（他们是第一受益者）、科技股（高估值、高成长是廉价资金的最爱）、房地产（低利率直接受益），还有加密货币（是流动性泛滥的狂欢）。在货币紧缩周期，你应该买那些最后受伤的资产，比如必须消费品（可口可乐、宝洁，需求刚性）、医疗保健（医药器械，非周期性）、公用事业（电力水务，现金流稳定），还有国债、现金（它们是最终的避风港）。</p>
<p><strong>核心认知三：量化投资策略。</strong> 你要关注通胀数据、失业率、十年期美债收益率。如果CPI下降、失业率上升，那么降息预期就会到来，你就可以做多。如果CPI上升、失业率低，那么加息预期就会到来，你应该做空或者观望。你还要关注美债市场的健康度（十年期美债收益率和二年期-十年期利差）。如果利差小于零，也就是收益率曲线倒挂了，那是衰退的警告。如果利差大于零点五，收益率曲线变陡，代表经济可能复苏。</p>
<p><strong>核心认知四：长期投资的核心是在危机中买入，在狂热中卖出。</strong> 2020年3月疫情崩盘，标普五百跌到两千三百点；2021年年底万物泡沫，标普五百涨到了四千八百点。如果你在三月买入，在十二月卖出，你可以赚百分之一百零八。但很可惜，百分之九十九的人都做反了：他们在三月恐慌卖出，在十二月又FOMO（也就是害怕错失机会）跟风买入。长线投资不是买蓝筹股躺平，而是买那些在货币宽松周期中受益最大，在紧缩周期中受伤最小的资产。</p>
<p><strong>核心认知五：永远记住玛利亚。</strong> 投资不只是赚钱，也是理解世界。一美元的故事告诉我们：货币体系是一个财富再分配机制。印钞的受益者是资产持有者，而印钞的受害者是工资收入者。通胀不是自然现象，是政策选择。政府选择印钞，就选择了通胀，也就选择了财富转移。市场不是中性的，它是有偏向性的。它偏向资本而非劳动，偏向金融而非实体，偏向富人而非穷人。</p>
<p>赚钱时要记住，那是系统性的优势，不只是你的能力。亏钱时要记住，那也是系统性的风险，不只是你的失误。最重要的是，各位，理解游戏规则，而不是抱怨不公平。玛利亚没有错，她努力工作，勤俭持家，但她在一个对她不利的游戏里。</p>
<p>2026年某个清晨，华盛顿特区，财政部长在新闻发布会上宣布：“鉴于经济增长放缓，我们将发行新一轮国债，规模两万亿美元。”纽约美联储交易大厅，交易员的手指放在键盘上，屏幕上跳出指令：“联邦储备系统，量化宽松方案重启，等待授权。”</p>
<p>某处，一个新的“一美元”即将诞生。他会经历和我一样的旅程吗？还是会见证不同的世界？没人知道。但只要这个货币体系还在运行，只要债务还在增长，只要美联储还有印钞权，就会有无数个“我”在虚空中流转，在经济中流转，在金融中跃迁，在实体中磨损，在数据中消亡。</p>
<p>这就是一美元的量子人生，也是现代货币体系的永恒轮回。</p>

          <p>他记得祖父说过，神羡慕凡人，因为死亡让每个瞬间都成为绝响。他自己是制盾匠人，双手抚过牛皮与青铜的冷涩，将英雄的轮廓敲进坚硬的弧度。那些远航的战士，出征前总爱谈论永恒的光荣，仿佛那是一个值得用全部生命去交换的匣子。他在盾牌上雕刻海浪与城郭，雕出他们口中“为希腊而战”的恢弘梦想，却在纹路的间隙里，藏入一粒故乡的沙。</p>
<p>战争的声音像远雷般传来，又像潮水般退去。归来的不再是夸耀胜利的年轻人，而是一个沉默的异国王子，眼神里没有光荣，只有燃尽的灰。王子放下残破的剑，说这不是他的战争，却带走了所有人的安宁。匠人修复那柄剑时，感到一种远比青铜沉重的疲惫，它不属于任何个人，而是整个时代的重量。</p>
<p>他最终没有完成那面最华丽的盾牌。他带着那粒沙，走向远离海岸的荒地。风侵蚀着岩石，宛如时间侵蚀着传奇。他将沙粒埋入干涸的土地，想象它或许会长出什么无关胜负的东西。光荣如此渺小，而一粒沙的重，却能承载一片不曾被传唱的沉默。风吹过，远处仿佛仍有海浪声，只是不再为任何名字澎湃。</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>上周末，我的个人博客 <code>let-ai.com</code> 在Google Search Console中收到了“重定向错误”的警告。这触发了一场长达数小时的问题排查，最终问题核心锁定在一个经典的现代Web架构冲突上：<strong>GitHub Pages的HTTPS强制策略、Cloudflare的代理规则与Hexo静态生成器的部署流程，三者间产生了意料之外的相互抵消</strong>。本文将复盘整个排查与修复过程。</p>
<h2 id="问题表象：搜索引擎的“重定向错误”警告"><a href="#问题表象：搜索引擎的“重定向错误”警告" class="headerlink" title="问题表象：搜索引擎的“重定向错误”警告"></a>问题表象：搜索引擎的“重定向错误”警告</h2><p>最初，症状很明确：Google认为我的网站 <code>let-ai.com</code> 存在不正确的重定向。使用 <code>curl</code> 命令进行诊断，发现了第一个异常：</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl -I http://let-ai.com</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># 期望：HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># 实际：返回了308</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>这意味着，当用户或搜索引擎通过HTTP协议访问时，网站没有返回一个标准的永久重定向(<code>301</code>)到HTTPS版本，这不利于SEO权重传递和用户体验。</p>
<h2 id="第一层排查：GitHub-Pages配置与DNS记录"><a href="#第一层排查：GitHub-Pages配置与DNS记录" class="headerlink" title="第一层排查：GitHub Pages配置与DNS记录"></a>第一层排查：GitHub Pages配置与DNS记录</h2><p>我的网站 <code>let-ai.com</code> 托管在 <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> 上，背后是 <code>twoken404.github.io</code> 仓库，并使用 <strong>Cloudflare</strong> 管理DNS和提供CDN加速。因此，排查从这两处开始。</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GitHub Pages设置</strong>：进入仓库的 <code>Settings -&gt; Pages</code>，发现“Custom domain”一栏有时为空，有时设置了 <code>let-ai.com</code>，但下方的 <strong>“Enforce HTTPS”</strong> 复选框经常是灰色不可选状态。这是关键线索，表明GitHub无法为此域名自动签发SSL证书。</li>
<li><strong>Cloudflare DNS检查</strong>：在Cloudflare控制台检查 <code>let-ai.com</code> 的DNS记录。发现了一条<code>CNAME</code>记录指向 <code>twoken404.github.io</code>，但<strong>代理状态为“DNS only”（灰色云朵）</strong>。这意味着Cloudflare只负责DNS解析，流量没有经过它的代理网络，直接到达GitHub。</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="第二层深入：ssl证书失败"><a href="#第二层深入：ssl证书失败" class="headerlink" title="第二层深入：ssl证书失败"></a>第二层深入：ssl证书失败</h2><p>单独看每项配置似乎都没大问题，但组合起来就形成了死结：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>症结一：证书签发失败</strong>。GitHub Pages要为自定义域名启用HTTPS，其合作方(Let‘s Encrypt)需要能通过HTTP访问到你的域名以验证所有权。但由于我的DNS是“DNS only”，验证请求可能无法可靠抵达GitHub，导致证书签发失败，从而“Enforce HTTPS”选项失效。</li>
<li><strong>症结二：缺少代理层重定向</strong>。Cloudflare的“Always Use HTTPS”重定向功能，<strong>必须在代理开启（Proxied）状态下才生效</strong>。我的“DNS only”设置使得这一层重定向完全缺失。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="第三层意外：Hexo部署流程的“副作用”"><a href="#第三层意外：Hexo部署流程的“副作用”" class="headerlink" title="第三层意外：Hexo部署流程的“副作用”"></a>第三层意外：Hexo部署流程的“副作用”</h2><p>在修复DNS，将代理状态改为“Proxied”，并成功在GitHub Pages启用HTTPS后，问题曾一度解决。但几天后，<strong>自定义域名设置再次从GitHub页面中消失</strong>。</p>
<p>经过复盘，发现了一个隐藏的“操作冲突”：我使用 <strong>Hexo</strong> 静态博客框架，通过 <code>hexo deploy</code> 命令部署。该命令会将本地 <code>public</code> 文件夹的内容推送到GitHub仓库的<code>gh-pages</code>分支。而GitHub Pages的在线域名设置，<strong>实质上是在该分支根目录自动生成一个 <code>CNAME</code> 文件</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>冲突就在这里</strong>：我的Hexo本地项目源文件中，没有包含 <code>CNAME</code> 文件。因此，每次执行 <code>hexo deploy</code>，新生成的 <code>public</code> 文件夹（不含<code>CNAME</code>文件）都会覆盖GitHub上的<code>gh-pages</code>分支，<strong>顺手就把GitHub自动生成的 <code>CNAME</code> 文件删除了</strong>。这个文件一消失，GitHub Pages就认为我取消了自定义域名，于是设置页面里的记录也随之清空。</p>
<h2 id="最终解决方案"><a href="#最终解决方案" class="headerlink" title="最终解决方案"></a>最终解决方案</h2><p>修复需要确保三个地方的配置一致且稳固：</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>：确保 <code>let-ai.com</code> 的<code>CNAME</code>记录代理状态为 <strong>“Proxied”</strong>（橙色云朵）。这将激活Cloudflare的“Always Use HTTPS”功能，在边缘网络完成第一道<code>301</code>重定向。</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong>：在仓库设置页重新添加 <code>let-ai.com</code> 域名，并等待其自动签发SSL证书，然后<strong>务必勾选“Enforce HTTPS”</strong>。这确保了源站层面的安全强制。</li>
<li><strong>Hexo本地项目</strong>：在Hexo项目源文件的 <code>source/</code> 目录根层级下，<strong>手动创建一个 <code>CNAME</code> 文件</strong>，内容只有一行：<code>let-ai.com</code>。这样，每次执行 <code>hexo generate</code>，这个文件都会被复制到 <code>public</code> 文件夹，从而在部署时能永久保留在GitHub仓库中，与在线设置形成互补，防止被覆盖。</li>
</ol>
